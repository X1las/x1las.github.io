        <h1>Divinity Mechanics</h1>
        <hr>
        
        <p>The 5e "Divinity" system is inspired by the action economy from Divinity Original Sin 2.</p>
        
        <h2>Premise</h2>
        <hr id="half">

        <p>Combat works the same as before, but instead of 1 action, 1 bonus action, and 30ft of movement, players now have 4 <b><i>Action Points</i> (AP)</b> to spend as they wish, plus 2 <b><i>Reaction Points</i> (RP)</b> for use between turns.</p>
        
        <h3>Action Points</h3>

        <p>Any action that normally takes an action in 5e D&D costs <b>2 AP</b> in the divinity system. This includes attacking, spellcasting, dashing, disengaging, dodging, helping, hiding, readying an action, searching, and using an object. See Crobi's <a href="https://crobi.github.io/dnd5e-quickref/preview/quickref.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Quick References</a> guide for more info.</p>
        <p>Any action that normally takes a bonus action in 5e D&D costs <b>1 AP</b> in the divinity system. This includes attacking with an offhand weapon, casting a spell with a casting time of 1 bonus action, and using a class feature that requires a bonus action.</p>
        <p>Any action that normally takes movement in 5e D&D costs <b>1 AP</b> per half of your movement speed. This includes moving, climbing, swimming, crawling, and flying.</p>
        <p>Players can use their full movement and perform an action in one turn. They can also make two attacks if standing still or use a bonus action to drink a potion.</p>

        <p>For balancing purposes, players are only allowed to perform one of each kind of bonus action per turn. For example, this means that Rogues with their Cunning Action can only perform one dash movement that would otherwise result in 120 feet of movement for a round.</p>

        <p>However, it is possible to use <i>Inspirations</i> to acquire more AP in combat, a Heroic Inspiration can be expended for <b>2 AP</b> whereas a bardic inspiration can be exchanged for <b>1 AP</b>.</p>

        <h3>Reactions</h3>

        <p>Each turn, players get <b>2 RP</b> to react to events outside their own turns.</p>
        <p>Typically, players only get one reaction per turn, such as an attack of opportunity, the only difference here is that now if you have an ability or feature that lets you perform different kinds of reactions, their cost is reduced to <b>1 RP</b>, letting you use them twice in-between rounds.</p>
        
        <p>These are different from Readied Actions or Attacks of opportunity, that still require <b>2 RP</b> to be performed.</p>

        <h3>Ready Action</h3>

        <p>If you as a player use the <i>Ready</i> action, you gain an additional <b>1 RP</b> and can specify a trigger for a <i>Prepared Action</i> if you want to, reserving <b>2 RP</b> that can't be spent otherwise.</p>
        <p>However, the <i>Ready</i> action can also be used to prepare <b>2 AP</b> for the next round, so long as it doesn't exceed the <b>6 AP</b> maximum.</p>


        <h2>Cost Structure</h2>
        <hr id="half">

        <p>Action and Reaction costs within Divinity 5e are shown below:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
            <th>Actions</th>
            <th>Bonus Actions</th>
            <th>Movement</th>
            <th>General Reaction <br> Readied Action</th>
            <th>Class/Feature Reaction</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
            <td>2 AP</td>
            <td>1 AP</td>
            <td>1 AP per <br>halved movement speed</td>
            <td>2 RP</td>
            <td>1 RP</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Action and Reaction Points refresh each turn. Players can use their full movement and perform an action in one turn. They can also make two attacks if standing still or use a bonus action to drink a potion.</p>
