        <h1>Divinity Mechanics</h1>
        <hr>
        
        <p>The 5e &quot;Divinity&quot; system is based on the action economy of Divinity Original Sin 2.</p>
        
        <h1>Premise</h1>
        <hr id="half">

        <p>Combat resolves the same way as before, the only exception is that instead of the previous 1 action, 1 bonus action and 30ft of movement, the players get 4 action points to spend on whatever they please.</p>
        
        <h2>Cost Structure</h2>
        <hr id="half">

        <p>Every normal choice a player can make in 5e is partitioned into action point cost as seen in the table below</p>
        
        <table>
        
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Actions</th>
                    <th>Bonus Actions</th>
                    <th>Movement</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>2 action points</td>
                    <td>1 action point</td>
                    <td>1 action points per <br>half movement speed</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Action points get refreshed after each turn, and have been assigned such that a player would be able to take there entire movement and do an action within one turn. This extends beyond the basic premise by allowing the player to make two attacks a turn if they are standing still, or take an additional bonus action to consume a healing potion if they so choose.</p>
        
        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        
        <ul>
            <li>By default, every <strong><em>type</em></strong> of bonus action can only be taken once per turn
                <ul>
                    <li>You&#39;re not allowed to drink two potions a turn, but can stab someone with your offhand whilst drinking a potion.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A point of movement is equivalent to half your movement rounded down to the nearest 5 ft.</li>
            <li>Additional points can be awarded or given depending on situation and gear</li>
            <li>An inspiration can be chosen to be converted into an action point if needed</li>
            <li>You can save two action points for another round by using the &quot;<strong>Ready</strong>&quot; action up to a max of 6</li>
        </ul>
