        <hr>
        
        <p>Feats are special abilities that give characters unique capabilities. Here are some popular feats from D&D 5e:</p>
        
        <h2>Alert</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>Always on the lookout for danger, you gain the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You gain a +5 bonus to initiative.</li>
            <li>You can't be surprised while you are conscious.</li>
            <li>Other creatures don't gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being unseen by you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Sharpshooter</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.</li>
            <li>Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.</li>
            <li>Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Great Weapon Master</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>Youâ€™ve learned to put the weight of a weapon to your advantage, letting its momentum empower your strikes. You gain the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.</li>
            <li>Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Lucky</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment. You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.</p>
        
        <h2>Mobile</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>You are exceptionally speedy and agile. You gain the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
            <li>When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn.</li>
            <li>When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.</li>
        </ul>
