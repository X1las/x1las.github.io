        <h1>Combat Basics</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Combat in D&D 5e is turn-based and organized into rounds. Each round, every participant gets one turn to act. For an alternative combat system, check out our <a href="divinity.html">Divinity Combat Rules</a>.</p>

        <h2>Initiative</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>At the start of combat, everyone rolls initiative (d20 + Dexterity modifier). This determines the order in which participants take their turns.</p>
        
        <h2>Surprise</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>If you come across enemies that aren't aware of you, you might surprise them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The DM determines who might be surprised</li>
            <li>If you're hidden, compare your Stealth check to enemies' passive Perception</li>
            <li>Surprised creatures can't move or take actions on their first turn</li>
            <li>Surprised creatures can't take reactions until after their first turn</li>
            <li>After the first turn, surprise ends and combat continues normally</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Your Turn</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>On your turn, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Move</b> up to your speed (usually 30 feet)</li>
            <li>Take one <b>Action</b></li>
            <li>Take one <b>Bonus Action</b> (if available)</li>
            <li>Use one <b>Free Action</b> (like speaking or dropping an item)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Actions in Combat</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>Common actions you can take:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Attack</b>: Make one or more attacks</li>
            <li><b>Cast a Spell</b>: Cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action</li>
            <li><b>Dash</b>: Double your movement speed</li>
            <li><b>Disengage</b>: Move away without provoking opportunity attacks</li>
            <li><b>Dodge</b>: Impose disadvantage on attacks against you</li>
            <li><b>Help</b>: Give advantage to an ally's next ability check or attack</li>
            <li><b>Hide</b>: Make a Stealth check to hide</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Making an Attack</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>To make an attack:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose a target within range</li>
            <li>Roll d20 + attack modifier</li>
            <li>Compare to target's AC</li>
            <li>If you hit, roll damage</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cover</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>Objects can provide cover to targets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Half Cover</b>: +2 to AC and Dexterity saving throws</li>
            <li><b>Three-Quarters Cover</b>: +5 to AC and Dexterity saving throws</li>
            <li><b>Full Cover</b>: Can't be targeted directly</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reactions</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>You get one reaction per round, which you can use for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Opportunity Attacks</b>: When an enemy leaves your reach</li>
            <li><b>Ready Action</b>: When your specified trigger occurs</li>
            <li><b>Certain Spells</b>: Such as Shield or Counterspell</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conditions</h2>
        <hr id="half">
        <p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in various ways:</p>
