        <h1>Making a New Player Character</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>When getting to make your new dnd character, make sure you have run through this checklist beforehand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have a <a href="2024.pdf" download> copy</a> of the Player's Handbook (PHB) ready to look up in
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you have a set of D&D dice to roll with, either physical or online</li>
            <li>Ask your DM about what books you are allowed to use for character creation (default is just Player's
                Handbook)</li>
            <li>Have a <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/5E_CharacterSheet_Fillable.pdf"
                    target="_blank">character sheet</a> ready to fill out</li>
            <li>If you are filling it out on paper, have a pencil and erasor ready. NO INK! You will need to erase
                often!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are ever in doubt about what steps to take on character creation, you can always check out Chapter 2
            of the Player's Handbook or consult your DM.</p>

        <p>Additionally, if you have an idea of a character you want to play, you can usually find a way carry it out in
            D&D format, but keep in mind starting characters are not superheroes, but more akin to your average
            traveller.</p>

        <h2>Choose Your Class</h2>

        <p>To start off, choose a class on the class table of the PHB, the classes are as such:</p>

        </table>

        <p>Each class has its own interests, abilities and varying degrees of complexity. If you want to try something
            easy, then the Rogue and Fighter classes are great starters. For more info about each class, consult the
            List of Contents in the PHB to find the specific class chapter.</p>

        <p>When you have found an interesting class, write it down at the top of your character sheet so you remember.
        </p>

        <p>Afterwards, note the <i>class features</i> that your given class provides, just make sure it applies to the
            level you begin at.</p>

        <h2>Make a Character Background</h2>
        <hr id="half">

        <p>For this part of character creation, you will be creating your character background.</p>

        <p>A character background contains three elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Backstory</li>
            <li>Origin</li>
            <li>Race/Species</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These three elements shape your character's identity and help you as well as your DM to guide roleplaying
            elements of the game. You can choose to go about character background in two ways: Origin first or Backstory
            first. Origins serve as the primary ability-givers of a certain backstory, so choosing an origin that goes
            along with your class is not a bad idea for a first character. However, if you have a backstory in mind be
            sure to flesh it out before you choose an origin, as you will need both for a character it's important your
            origin matches the background story you have written.</p>

        <p>For ideas on backstories, consider the class overview as mentioned in the class section.</p>

        <h3>Write a Backstory</h3>
        <hr id="half">

        <p>To start off, write a short backstory for your character. This can be as simple as a few sentences or as
            complex as a few paragraphs. The backstory should include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Where your character was born</li>
            <li>What their childhood was like</li>
            <li>Any significant events that shaped their life</li>
            <li>What they are doing now and why they are adventuring</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you don't know what to write, or don't have any great ideas for a character, you can always leave it blank
            or pick it up <i>after</i> having filled out your character origins. You should, however, fill out your
            backstory eventually, as it is the primary way you get to shape the story of your DM's campaign.</p>

        <h3>Choose Your Origin</h3>
        <hr id="half">

        <p>Choosing an origin for your character defines in part the direction of your character's background story,
            and it gives you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ability Score Increases</li>
            <li>A Feat</li>
            <li>Skill Proficiencies</li>
            <li>Tool Proficiencies</li>
            <li>Equipment (or 50 GP)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each origin has its own set of ability scores it can improve, and serves to show what kind of builds or
            classes they pair well with.</p>

        <p>Choosing a race for your character is usually the last part in the character creation process, as it defines
            the physical and cultural traits of your character. Whilst some races are more suited for combat and others
            for magic, you can also choose races based entirely on personal preference.</p>

        <p>It is up to your DM's discretion how many "Homebrew" races are allowed and what they do, but the list above are default choices to choose from.</p>

        <h3>At the End of Your Character Creation</h3>
        <hr id="half">

        <p>When you have finished your character creation, you should make sure your character has name, a class and an origin noted down.</p>

        <p>Now, as for last steps, you need to calculate your AC (Armor Class), HP (Hit Points) and note your Initiative.</p>

        <p>To calculate your AC, you need to know what armor you are wearing. If you are not wearing any armor, your AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If you are wearing armor, consult the PHB for the specific armor's AC value.</p>

        <p>To calculate your HP, you need to know your class's hit die and your Constitution modifier. Your starting HP is the maximum value of your class's hit die plus your Constitution modifier. For example, if you are a Fighter with a d10 hit die and a Constitution modifier of +2, your starting HP would be 10 (max of d10) + 2 = 12 HP.</p>

        <p>Finally, your Initiative is equal to your Dexterity modifier. This is the bonus you add to your initiative rolls at the start of combat.</p>

        <p>Make sure to note these things down on your character sheet and send it to your DM for proof-reading!</p>
